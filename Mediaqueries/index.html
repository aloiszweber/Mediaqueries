              Cha
              
              Hear the sound of the falling rain
              Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)
              The shame, the ones who died without a name
              Hear the dogs howling out of key
              To a hymn called "Faith and Misery" (Hey!)
              And bleed, the company lost the war today </p> <br>

              <p class="paragraph"> Hear the drum pounding out of time
              Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)
              To find the money's on the other side
              Can I get another Amen? (Amen!)
              There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)
              A gag, a plastic bag on a monument </p> <br>

              "The representative from California has the floor."
              Sieg Heil to the president Gasman
              Bombs away is your punishment
              Pulverize the Eiffel towers
              Who criticize your government
              Bang bang goes the broken glass
              And kill all the fags that don't agree
              Trials by fire, setting fire
              Is not a way that's meant for me
              Just ‘cause (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
              Just ‘cause (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
              Because we're outlaws, yeah! </p> <br>

              <p class="paragraph"> I remembered black skies
              The lightning all around me
              I remembered each flash
              As time began to blur
              Like a startling sign
              That fate had finally found me
              And your voice was all I heard

              <p class="paragraph"> So give me reason
              To prove me wrong
              To wash this memory clean
              Let the floods cross
              The distance in your eyes
              Give me reason
              To fill this hole
              Connect this space between
              Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
              Across this new divide </p> <br>
              
              <p class="paragraph"> There was nothing in sight
              But memories left abandoned
              There was nowhere to hide
              The ashes fell like snow
              And the ground caved in
              Between where we were standing
              And your voice was all I heard
              That I get what I deserve </p> <br>

              Across this new divide </p> <br>
              
              <p class="paragraph"> In every loss in every lie
              In every truth that you deny
              And each regret and each goodbye
              Was a mistake too great to hide
              And your voice was all I heard
              That I get what I deserve </p> <br>
